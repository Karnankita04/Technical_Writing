## Getting Started

### Sign Up and Login

Visit the [Auth0 website](https://auth0.com/) to sign up for an account. After signing up, log in to access the Auth0 Dashboard.

### Dashboard Overview

The Auth0 Dashboard is your central hub for managing users, applications, and settings. Explore the various sections to configure authentication, authorization, and other features.

## Authentication

### Authentication Flows

Auth0 supports various authentication flows, including:

- Device Authorization Flow

Understand each flow and choose the one that best fits your application's needs.

### Supported Identity Providers

Integrate Auth0 with popular identity providers such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and more. This allows users to log in using their existing credentials.

### Multifactor Authentication

Enhance security with multifactor authentication (MFA). Learn how to enable and configure MFA options for your applications.

## Authorization

### Roles and Permissions

Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using Auth0's roles and permissions feature. Define roles, assign permissions, and manage user access effectively.

### Scopes

Understand and configure scopes to control the level of access granted to applications. Define scopes based on the resources your application needs to access.

## Security Best Practices

## Integration

### Web Applications

Integrate Auth0 with your web applications using SDKs and sample code. Follow step-by-step guides for various programming languages.

### Mobile Applications

Secure your mobile applications with Auth0. Learn how to implement authentication and authorization in iOS and Android applications.

### Single Page Applications (SPAs)

Implement authentication in single-page applications using Auth0's SPA SDK. Configure silent authentication and handle token renewal.

## Customization

### Branding

Customize the appearance of the Auth0 login page to match your application's branding. Add logos, colors, and other elements to create a seamless user experience.

### Lock Widget Customization

Customize the Lock widget to tailor the authentication interface. Modify styles, add custom fields, and personalize the login experience for users.

## Analytics and Monitoring

### User Logs

Review user logs in the Auth0 Dashboard to monitor authentication and authorization events. Analyze user activity and identify potential security issues.

### Real-time Webhooks

Set up real-time webhooks to receive notifications for specific events, such as user sign-ups or password changes. Integrate Auth0 with external services for advanced analytics.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
