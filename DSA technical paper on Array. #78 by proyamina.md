Definition: An array is a fundamental data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. It provides a systematic and contiguous way to organize and access data in memory.
Purpose: Arrays are widely used for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation in various programming languages.

# 2. Basic Properties of Arrays:
Structure and Representation: Arrays consist of elements of the same data type arranged in contiguous memory locations. The elements are accessed using indices, starting from 0 in many programming languages.
Indexing and Accessing Elements: Accessing elements is achieved through their indices, enabling direct and constant-time access to any element.
Memory Allocation and Contiguity: Arrays use contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient memory management and cache utilization.

One-Dimensional Arrays: A linear arrangement of elements, accessible with a single index.
Multi-Dimensional Arrays: Arrays with multiple indices, forming grids or matrices.
Dynamic Arrays: Arrays that can dynamically resize, adapting to the required storage.
