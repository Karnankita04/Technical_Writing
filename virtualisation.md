# Virtualization in Windows

(1) Virtualization in Windows refers to the process of creating and running multiple virtual instances of operating systems on a single physical computer.  
(2) So one can run different operating systems like Android or Linux and applications simultaneously on the same hardware.  
(3) But it requires specific configurations.  
(4) Enabling virtualization gives you access to a more extensive library of apps to use and install on your PC  
(5) Many apps and software are compatible with virtualization technology.   

# Use case of virtualisation

For example, Bluestacks is an App Player that enables the execution of Android applications on computers running Microsoft Windows or macOS

- Bluestacks is often used to play games which are mobile/android compatible only on a computer. 
- This is achieved by running android instance on computer.
- So basically we will be using android on computer ! cool , isin't.
- But all of this is about the features that bluestacks gives , the question is where virtualisation is in the picture of bluestacks ?
- The answer lies in the fact that enabling virtualization makes such softwares run faster and without any lag.
- The virtual copy of the CPU will be utilised by such apps using virtuaisation technology only.
- While it can run with VT (Virtualization Technology) disabled, it may lag significantly.

## Enabling Virtualization in Windows

Follow these steps to enable virtualization:

1. **Go to BIOS Settings:**
   - Pressing your assigned BIOS hotkey while your computer boots up should retrieve the BIOS setup utility screen youâ€™re looking for.
   - some famous hotkeys are F2 , esc , F12 etc.

2. **Navigate to System and Advanced Settings:**
   - Within the BIOS settings, find the section related to advanced settings.

3. **Locate the Virtualization Option:**
   - Look for the option related to virtualization. It may be named "Virtualization" or "VT."

4. **Toggle Virtualization to Enabled:**
   - Once you've located the virtualization option, toggle it to "Enabled."

## Parting notes
- These steps ensure the virtualization feature is activated in the computer's hardware, allowing you to make the most of virtualization   technology for running multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously.
- It is recommended to enable virtualisation for the apps or softwares that requires it.
- Otherwise for all other tasks where it is not required then enabling it also doesnot add much to the performance of the computer.
