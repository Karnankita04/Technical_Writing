# Virtualization in Windows

(1) Virtualization in Windows refers to the process of creating and running multiple virtual instances of operating systems on a single physical computer.  
(2) So one can run different operating systems like Android or Linux and applications simultaneously on the same hardware.  
(3) But it requires specific configurations.  
(4) Enabling virtualization gives you access to a more extensive library of apps to use and install on your PC  
(5) Many apps and software are compatible with virtualization technology.   

For example, Bluestacks is an App Player that enables the execution of Android applications on computers running Microsoft Windows or macOS
- Bluestacks are often used to play mobile games on a computer by running Android on Windows. 
- This scenario demonstrates the necessity of enabling virtualization for a smoother process.
- While it can run with VT (Virtualization Technology) disabled, it may lag significantly.

4. **Toggle Virtualization to Enabled:**
   - Once you've located the virtualization option, toggle it to "Enabled."

These steps ensure the virtualization feature is activated in the computer's hardware, allowing you to make the most of virtualization technology for running multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously.
