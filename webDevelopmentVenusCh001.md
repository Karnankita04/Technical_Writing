### (4) Hands-on 
- web development is all about development. 
- rather than learning tags of html and blindly memorising css and js , start implementing them .
- make project and read documentation and again make project, this cycle should continue like this.
- start loving documentation , it will be useful for you in the long run also.
- start from basic projects and don't copy paste from chatgpt or other online resources.
- after the basic project add more advanced features to your project.
### (5) Ignore AI
- yes it is true that a whole working website can be built with artificial intelligence by just giving one  
  prompt only.
- But we should not forget that AI works on the information given to it by human.
- So human beings are creative and so are you and so ignore ai when you are in the phase of learning web development
- don't use ai to build for you .
- if you want to use ai then use it to learn web deveolpment and not as a copy paste mechanism .
