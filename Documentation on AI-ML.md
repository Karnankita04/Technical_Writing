# Introduction

## 1.1 AI – Artificial Intelligence

AI is the broader concept of enabling a machine or system to sense, reason, act, or adapt like a human. It refers to the use of technologies to build machines and computers that have the ability to mimic cognitive functions associated with human intelligence, such as being able to see, understand, and respond to spoken or written language, analyze data, make recommendations, and more.

## 1.2 ML – Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that automatically enables machines to extract knowledge from data and learn from it autonomously. Instead of explicit programming, machine learning uses algorithms to analyze large amounts of data, learn from the insights, and then make informed decisions.

# Connection Between AI And ML

AI is a broader concept that encompasses any technique that allows computers to mimic human intelligence. ML is one of the ways to achieve this goal within the field of AI.
ML is considered a subset of AI because it focuses on the development of algorithms that enable computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.
ML is a key component of many AI systems. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, an AI system using ML learns from examples and experiences. ML algorithms allow AI systems to improve their performance on a specific task over time as they are exposed to more data. This adaptability is a crucial aspect of intelligent systems.
