ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that JavaScript is based on. ES6 brought significant enhancements to the language, introducing new features and syntax improvements to make JavaScript more powerful, expressive, and easier to work with.

# <h2>Major Features of ECMAScript 6:</h2>

# Arrow Functions:
Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They are more concise than traditional function expressions and have a lexical this, meaning they inherit the this value from the surrounding code.
javascript
Copy code:

`// Traditional function expression
let add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
// Arrow function
let add = (a, b) => a + b;`
# Template Literals:
Template literals allow for more flexible and readable string interpolation. They use backticks (``) and support multi-line strings and expressions embedded using ${}.

javascript
Copy code:

`let name = "John";
let greeting =`Hello, ${name}!`; `
# Destructuring Assignment:
Destructuring assignment allows you to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a more concise way.
javascript
Copy code:

// Array destructuring
`let [a, b] = [1, 2];

// Object destructuring
let { x, y } = { x: 1, y: 2 };`
# Classes:
ES6 introduced class syntax, making it easier to create and work with constructor functions and prototypes. It provides a more familiar and cleaner syntax for object-oriented programming.
javascript
Copy code:

`class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
}
let person = new Person("Alice", 25);`
# Promises:
Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations more easily and with better readability. They simplify callback hell and provide a cleaner syntax for working with asynchronous code.
javascript
Copy code:

`function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Asynchronous operation
    if (/* operation is successful */) {
      resolve(data);
    } else {
      reject(error);
    }
  });
}`
# Modules:
ES6 introduced a native module system for organizing and encapsulating code. Modules enable better code structure, maintainability, and allow for the export and import of functionalities between files.
javascript
Copy code:

`// Exporting in a module
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Importing in another module
import { add } from './math';
Spread/Rest Operators:`
# The spread (...) and rest (...) operators:
provide a concise way to work with arrays and function parameters. The spread operator can be used to spread elements of an array or object, while the rest operator collects multiple parameters into a single array.
javascript
Copy code:

`// Spread operator
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];`

// Rest operator
`function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
}``
These features collectively enhance the readability, maintainability, and expressiveness of JavaScript code, making it a more modern and powerful language for web development.
